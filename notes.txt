A route defines the URL of the page.

The controller is where we write PHP code to build that page
(ie: HTML, JSON)

routes.yaml
   index:
      path: / - if we go to this page
      controller: App\Controller\DefaultController::index - execute index method on DefaultController class.

The only rule of a Symfony controller method (or "action") is that it must return a Symfony Response object.

------------- 04 -------------
Instead of using routes.yaml, you can write the route right above the method like this:
   class QuestionController {
      /**
      * @Route("/")
      */
      public function homepage() {
         return new Response('Whet a bewitching controller we have conjured!');
      }
   }

Twig has two syntaxes:
"say something": {{ code that prints something }}
"do something": {% whatever you need to do %}

comment: {# comment here #}

dump($slug, $this);
dd($slug, $this);

Both of these will print the variables in a very convenient form right on the page. dd will also die afterwards (it means Dump and Die).

If we use debug bundle (composer require debug), then all of this info won't be printed in the page, it'll be in the symfony devtools.

If we write in the console 'php bin/console server: dump' then symfony will dump everything (including ajax requests!) into the console

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}">
the asset() will prefix the path with what's necessary if we deploy the site to something that' s no a root directory. It also gives the ability to configure a global CDN
